# Checkers
 
This item was designed to be a fun little game of Checker/Draughts.

The file Checker&PlateHalf contains half of the baseplates and all of one player's counters in one print. The idea is that you print the file once in one colour, change your filament colour, then print the file again.

The different coloured counters are for different players and I suggest using the different coloured plates in a checkerboard pattern. Highly contrasting colours is my personal choice but you can do any colour you want.

I like to print the Connectors file in a different colour to either team just because it feels right but as always, that's your preference.

The GCODE files were exported for 0.4mm nozzle CrealityK1C with a 220*220 bed. The Blend file and the STLs allow for you to change the size and slicing however you want to.
